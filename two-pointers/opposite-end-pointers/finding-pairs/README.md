# Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
You cannot use the same element twice, and you may assume that there is exactly one solution.

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
