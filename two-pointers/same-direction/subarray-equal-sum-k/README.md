Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers nums and an integer k. Your task is to find the number of contiguous subarrays whose sum is exactly equal to k.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array, which means that the elements must be in consecutive order and should not be skipped.

```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two subarrays that sum up to `2`:
             - [1, 1] (from index 0 to 1)
             - [1, 1] (from index 1 to 2)

```
